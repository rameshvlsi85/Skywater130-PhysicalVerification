# Skywater130-PhysicalVerification
PV Workshop using Skywater 130nm technology


“Physical Verification using Skywater 130nm technology” Workshop intends to address various issues that come up during the design cycle as DRC/LVS violations. It aims to demonstrate the best approach to mitigate and rectify these violations. The course covers Physical Verification methodology using Magic,Netgen and OpenLane flow. It also explores the SKY130 PDK in detail, the knowledge of which is necessary to generate a robust design. This course starts with giving the basic idea of the design flow, PDK libraries and then takes a deep dive into the intricate concepts of Physical Verification with dedicated lecture and labs for each topic.
